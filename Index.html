<!-- Description is (use an <aside> for this) "A runaway ball. No leash to hold them back. Two inquisitive noses meet for the first time. <br>These two adorable puppers met when they were just a few months old in their local park in Fratton. They quickly struck up a bond and were soon inseperable, meeting every Thursday at the park entrance. Through COVID their bond remained strong, with weekly facetime calls and drivebys to each others houses so they could see their friend through the window. As quarantine dragged on with no discernable end in sight, their respective owners Ruth and John decided to get them together for a playdate. A couple of weeks later, Poppy announced happy news, she was pregnant with 5 puppies! It was then that Pawl stepped up and here they are getting married only a few weeks later!"-->
